            <h3>ABOUT:-</h3>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen);
            <b>15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015</b>) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman<b> who served as the
                11th
                president of India from 2002 to 2007</b>.
            He was born and raised in<b> Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu </b>and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
            spent
            the
            next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
            mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
            efforts.
            He thus came to be known as the <b>Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of ballistic
            missile
            and launch vehicle technology.
            He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests
            in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
